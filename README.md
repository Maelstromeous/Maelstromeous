# My hobby projects

## Planetside 2 Alerts
[PS2Alerts](https://ps2alerts.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ps2alerts/website)) is _the_ source for real time and aggregrated statistics around an in-game "metagame" event called Alerts within the game [Planetside 2](https://www.planetside2.com/what-is-ps2). The site has been operating for over 8 years, receieving various re-writes along the way.

## Satisfactory Factories
[Satisfactory Factories](https://satisfactory-factories.app) ([GitHub](https://github.com/satisfactory-factories/application)) is a web based Factory Logistics designer / planner for the game [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/). It enables users to keep track of what their factory is producing, how those products are then shipped to other factories, and it ensures the user has full analysis on how items are distributed, alerting the user of any errors.
